# OptimizeFunctions
A set of functions to optimize machine learning models. The purpose here is to have ready-to-use tools to fine-tune ML models.

### The models that we will focus on are:
- LightGBM
- XGBoost
- Adaboost

### The techniques that will be used are :
- Grid Search
- Random Grid Search
- Bayesian optimization

I will try to add more models and optimization functions in the future.
