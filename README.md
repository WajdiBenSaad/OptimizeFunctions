# Optimize Functions
A set of functions to optimize machine learning models. The purpose here is to have ready-to-use tools to fine-tune ML models.

"All_Algorithms" function will serve as a quick and fast tool to test the accuracy and runing time of a set of classification algorithms in only one simple function call. ( I will probably add more to this later as well).

### The techniques that will be used are :
- Grid Search
- Random Grid Search
- Bayesian optimization

### The models that we will focus on are:
- LightGBM
- XGBoost
- Adaboost



I will try to add more models and optimization functions in the future.
